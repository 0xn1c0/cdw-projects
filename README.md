# **Conflux Developer Workshop Final Project Guidelines**

## **Project Overview**

For the final project of the Conflux Developers Workshop, you will apply the skills and knowledge you've acquired to build a simple decentralized application (DApp). Choose one of the suggested project ideas or come up with your own. Make sure it aligns with the topics covered during the workshop and is feasible within the given timeline.

## **Requirements**

1. Your project must be built on the Conflux Network (eSpace).
2. Your project should include a smart contract written in Solidity.
3. Your project should have a front-end that interacts with the smart contract using Web3.js or a similar library.
4. The project must be functional and demonstrate the core concepts learned during the workshop.

## **Deliverables**

1. A detailed project proposal that includes:
    - Project title
    - Brief description
    - Key features
    - Use cases
    - Project timeline
2. Source code for the smart contract(s) and front-end.
3. Links to:
    1. Contract Addresses on ConfluxScan
    2. Front End Page
4. A README.md file that includes:
    - A brief explanation of your project
    - A list of the technologies and tools used
    - Instructions on how to set up, compile, and deploy your project
    - Screenshots or a video demo of the project in action
5. A brief report that outlines your development process, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## **Timeline**

- Week 1: Choose a project idea and submit a detailed project proposal.
- Week 2-3: Develop your smart contract and front-end.
- Week 4: Test and debug your project. Create a README.md file and finalize your report.
- Week 5: Submit your final project for review and present your project to the workshop participants.

## **Submission Instructions**

1. Fork this GitHub repository.
2. Create a new folder with your project's name in the "final-projects" directory.
3. Add your project's source code, README.md file, and report to the folder.
4. Create a pull request to the main workshop repository with your project folder.
5. In the pull request's description, provide a brief summary of your project and include a link to a video demo or screenshots.
6. Submit the pull request and share the link with the workshop instructor for review.

## **Building Your Project**

1. Plan your project carefully. Break it down into smaller tasks and allocate enough time to complete each task.
2. Use the tools and frameworks covered during the workshop, such as Truffle, Hardhat, and Web3.js, to streamline your development process.
3. Test your smart contract thoroughly using test suites and local blockchain networks like Ganache.
4. When building your front-end, focus on usability and user experience. Make it simple and intuitive for users to interact with your DApp.
5. Continuously document your progress and challenges faced. This information will be useful when writing your final report.

Good luck, and have fun building your final project!
