## Introduction

A GameFi project that allow to use ERC20 custom token and ERC1155 NFTs.The game is RPG and in-game currency is custom ERC20 token and weapons and armors are ERC1155 NFTs.Core elements of classic RPG games are ready in the project like take quests and earn tokens when finish them also kill enemies and loot tokens from them.Use tokens to buy weapons or armors so player become stronger and can kill the enemie boss.

## Tokenomics
My main idea is the game to become MMORPG with same core mechanics.Limited supply ERC20 token and limited to 1 NFT at wallet for ERC1155.With that tokenomics for erc20 its simulate mining and its deflational token easy can be inplement halving-just reduce what its drop wfom looting enemies and quests will give you less tokens.Just 1 NFT for a wallet prevent pay to win model-someone to buy all of the items and become too strong.One of the first thing that will be inplement is sposored trasactions or how Thirdweb call it gasless.In there thirdweb Unity SDK if you have sposored smart contract you can inplement local wallet so players no need metamask or some wallet it will be inplement in game and when player make accaunt he make his wallet.Also when they have not gonna pay gas players not see or be ask anything when transactions is done without player can even understand.Great think of this is that UX for web3 game will be the same like web2 game no more metamask or transactions and things like that.
