I start with that idea mainly because I think it will be pritty easy to make it but to deal with web3 compunents its more chalanging from just to make web2 game.
First I started with the core to make claim ERC20 and claim ERC1155 to work in UI buttons at Unity.With that I have some difficulties with implementing thirdweb SDK.
When use custom token to pay for ERC1155 NFTs its need to change code to approve ERC20 contract and just then its work proper.
Also have some problem with gas limit and authentification button.
After I handle web3 I made classic game elements.
Then I test so many times(that you can see from smart contract transactions)because always something not work proper or how I want.
At the end I am happy with result but still I know 1-2 things that not work so good but they can be fix pritty easy.  
In building process I learn about gasless smart contract(sposored gas)its kind of big thing for web3 games because many players just hate difficulties like need to have wallet(third web have solution for build in-game wallet)or handle gas trasactions.
One thing that I not learn in this project building process but is super inportant is that I call - just ask to find the solution.
Two times to find a solution of some problem I need to write to Thirdweb support team in Discord and they help me so much and so fast that I am realy amazed and gratefyl to them.
